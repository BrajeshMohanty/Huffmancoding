//this a project based On Huffman coding algorithm for data compression and decompression

Huffman Coding is a widely used data compression technique that offers
an optimal variable-length encoding by assigning shorter codes to more
frequently occurring characters in a given dataset. This project aims to
explain the design and implementation of Huffman Coding, showcasing
its effectiveness in reducing the size of data while preserving its
information content. By presenting the results of our implementation and
discussing its limitations, we explore the potential of Huffman Coding in
various scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss future enhancements and
alternative compression algorithms that could further improve data
compression techniques.

* Designing of Algorithm
❖ The goal of data compression is to reduce the size of data files while
preserving their essential information. Efficient compression techniques are of
paramount importance due to several reasons.
❖ Firstly, they optimize storage space, allowing for more data to be stored in
limited memory or disk capacity.
❖ Secondly, efficient compression enables faster data transmission over
networks, reducing bandwidth requirements and enhancing data transfer rates.
Additionally, compressed files require less time and resources for backup and
retrieval operations.
The Fundamental principle underlying Huffman Coding:
❖ The fundamental principle underlying Huffman Coding is the efficient
representation of data by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring
symbols.
❖ By analyzing the frequency distribution of symbols in a dataset, Huffman
Coding constructs a binary tree where each leaf node represents a symbol.
❖ The tree is built in a way that symbols with higher frequencies have shorter
code paths, while symbols with lower frequencies have longer code paths.
This variable-length encoding ensures that commonly occurring symbols are
represented by fewer bits, resulting in optimal compression.
